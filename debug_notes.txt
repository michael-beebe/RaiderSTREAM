THOUGHTS:
  - I've noticed that the validation piece gives different expected/observed
      results between the OpenMP version and the multi-node versions. Could
      this have something to do with the performance discrepency?

  - The VERBOSE printout for memory allocation is the some for all three
      implementations. However, in the multinode versions the STREAM arrays
      are distributed across PEs. Perhaps add more information to reflect the
      memory allocated on each single PE as well as the total mmeory allocated

TODO:
  - Get to the bottom of the performance discrepency
  - Update the comments at the top for each implementation
  - Update the GitHub README
  - Make sure the STREAM version printout is accurate
  - Get rid of the "OLD" source files once all of the code is good to go
  - Go through codes to make sure there is no TODOs or FIXMEs and that the comments are thorough
